# Fomantic Transition

This repository contains pre-compiled transition files using the default themes. This is intended for use in projects that do not need all the bells and whistles of Fomantic UI, and want to keep file size to a minimum.

For the latest changes please see the [Release Notes](https://github.com/fomantic/Fomantic-UI/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md)

If you're looking for the full version of Fomantic including all components and build tools [check out the main project repository](https://github.com/fomantic/Fomantic-UI)

Fomantic-UI is a community fork of the popular Semantic-UI framework.
